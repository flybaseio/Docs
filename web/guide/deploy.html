		<h3>Deploying Your App</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>You've build your Flybase app, and your almost ready to go into production! Before you put it out into the world, there are three important things you need to do:</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="panel panel-primary">
		<div class="panel-heading" id="section-start">Secure Your App</div>
		<div class="panel-body"> 
	
			<p>You can create custom API Keys that are unique to your app, you can set them to be read-only, or have full read / write access</p>
			
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="panel panel-primary">
		<div class="panel-heading">Passing JSON Web Tokens</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>If you don't want to pass your API key every time then you can also pass an encrypted JSON web token.</p>
			
			<p>This can be generated by passing the following POST query:</p>
			
			<pre><code class="language-javascript">
	curl -X POST https://api.flybase.io/create-token/YOUR-API-KEY
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>This will return a JSON object with <code>id_result</code> as the key, copy the contents of <code>id_result</code> to use elsewhere.</p>
				
			<p>Then you can pass the JSON token rather than your API key:</p>

			<pre><code class="language-javascript">
	var flybase = new Flybase("token:MYJWTTOKEN", "web", "posts");
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>Anytime <code>token:</code> is seen, Flybase will assume this is a JWT token and will retrieve your API Key from inside that, this helps secure your API key if you decide you'd rather not share it.</p>
			
			<p>Your white list rules are still followed for the API key you decide to include inside your token, so nothing changes aside from passing a token instead of an API key.</p>
			
			<p>You can set a custom <code>secret</code> to use for encrypting and decrypting tokens from your dashboard. You can also create tokens from there.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="panel panel-primary">
		<div class="panel-heading" id="section-start">Whitelist Your Domain</div>
		<div class="panel-body"> 
	
			<p>For every API Key you create, you can whitelist your domain so that the key can only be used on domains you've authorized. All Flybase apps have <code>localhost</code> and <code>127.0.0.1</code> enabled by default. To add your domain, navigate to the <strong>Your APi Keys</strong> tab on your Flybase Dashboard and add your domain under the <strong>White List</strong> section of your API Keys.</p>	
			
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="panel panel-primary">
		<div class="panel-heading" id="section-start">Upgrade Your Flybase Plan</div>
		<div class="panel-body"> 
	
			<p>Our Starter Plan allows up to 100 simultaneous device connections, or simultaneous users on your application. If 100 devices are currently connected and a 101st device attempts to connect to your app, the API will throw an error and any additional connections will fail. All of our <a href="https://flybase.io/pricing/">paid plans</a> have no hard caps on usage and are recommended for production apps.</p>
