			<p>Security is a really big topic, and it's very important. Traditionally, it has been one of the most difficult parts of app development. Flybase makes it a whole lot easier to secure your app. We take care of some parts entirely. Where we can't handle something completely, we simplify. For example, we provide a tool for whitelisting IPs and domains that can access your apps, and also for creating API Keys that only have certain permissions.</p>
			
			<p>This page describes how to build secure apps on Flybase. Flybase apps run more client-side code than those with many other technology stacks. Therefore, the way we approach security may be a bit different than you're used to.</p>

		<div class="panel-heading">Passing JSON Web Tokens</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			<p>If you don't want to pass your API key every time then you can also pass a JSON web token.</p>
			
			<p>This can be generated by passing the following POST query:</p>
						
			<pre><code class="language-javascript">
	curl -X POST https://api.flybase.io/create-token/YOUR-API-KEY
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>This will return a JSON object with <code>id_result</code> as the key, copy the contents of <code>id_result</code> to use elsewhere.</p>
				
			<p>Then you can pass the JSON token rather than your API key:</p>

			<pre><code class="language-javascript">
	var flybase = new Flybase("token:MYJWTTOKEN", "web", "posts");
			</code></pre>
			
			<p>Anytime <code>token:</code> is seen, Flybase will assume this is a JWT token and will retrieve your API Key from inside that, this helps secure your API key if you decide you'd rather not share it.</p>
