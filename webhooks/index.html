<p>Webhooks are a simple way to store data in your Flybase apps from external sources. They make use of normal HTTP requests with a JSON payload, which includes the message text and some options.</p>

<p>You can also use outgoing webhooks to send HTTP requests to other sources when new data is added to your Flybase app

	<p>Flybase provides a complete backend solution for your application. Generally, our goal is to eliminate the need for managing servers and writing server-side code. Our PHP SDK is for those applications and situations where server-side code is necessary, or simply preferred.</p>
	
	<p>The Flybase PHP SDK is fully open source, and anyone can contribute to make it better, or make their own changes if necessary. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/flybaseio/flybase-php">GitHub</a> repository for more information.</p>
	
	<p>The Flybase PHP SDK requires version 5.4 or greater of the PHP runtime.</p>

<p>You can use webhooks to handle events such as calls or messages from Twilio, all you have to do is go the <a href="https://app.flybase.io/webhooks">Your Webhooks</a> link in the top right menu of your dashboard, and create a new webhook that generates a unique incoming URL.</p>

<p>When you create a webhook, you can specify which collection inside which app to store data.</p>

<p>We’ve also given you three options for handling incoming data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Save All POSTed data</li>
	<li>Send a JSON string as the payload parameter in a POST request</li>
	<li>Send a JSON string as the body of a POST request</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason we’ve done this is to allow you to create more flexible webhooks that let you then store data from more sources.</p>
